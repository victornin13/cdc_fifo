Developed an 8-bit, 8-address FIFO in Verilog for clock domain crossing, incorporating Gray-coded pointer synchronization and dual flip-flop synchronizers. Verified functionality through comprehensive testbenches simulating various clock scenarios, full/empty conditions, and data integrity checks.

Utilized Synopsys and Cadence for synthesis, timing analysis, and back-annotated simulations to ensure accuracy and efficiency. Applied key methodologies such as static timing analysis and clock domain crossing techniques to achieve reliable operation.
